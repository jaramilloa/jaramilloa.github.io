    <p>hi bossâœ¨<br> i want to thank you for all the moments we have lived, I would've been here almost two hundred days, but I have known a lot about youðŸ¥¹ Thank you for all the time we spent together, for taking us out to get to know Korea by your hand, for all the laughs and dances. I always wish you become a main  character in many series because youâ€™re the main character for me, I appreciate your time, energy and effort to be with usâ™¥ I told you Iâ€™ll be here as long as you let me be here, I loveÂ youÂ soÂ much
