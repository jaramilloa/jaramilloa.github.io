    <p>Happy birthday Mir! ðŸŽ‰<br>
Today I can't even remember how I found you, I just know that when I realized you were already a important part of my day.  I am so grateful for be able to be with you on the broadcasts and to have met so many wonderful people there. <br> You are an inspiration... I wish you to make all your dreams come true, to continue with that smooth laugh, to have lots of love around you and health to enjoy life and live the best of the world!<br>
Thank you for always making me smile!<br>
Happy birthday stubborn dangerous bad cute dragon boy!  ðŸ¥°</p>
