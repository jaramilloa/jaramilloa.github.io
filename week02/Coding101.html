  <h1>My second page..</h1>
 <p>I am working on this page for my second week of <em>Beginning Web Programming</em> class. By the time you read this I may not be working on it though, but you know what I mean. Hopefully... Anywho lets get started.&#128522;</p>
  <p>&#127989;&#127989;&#127989;&#127989;&#127989;&#127989;&#127989;&#127989;</p>
  <p>For starters, I want to introduce myself. This is Ana Jaramillo and I am part of <strong><em>the best track</em></strong> which is the App Development Track at YU.<br>
  I want to welcome you fellow aliens <span>&#128406;&#127996;</span>&#128125; to my second page. In case you are wondering why I call you all aliens, it is because I am a &#9789; <em>moonchild!</em> &#9790;</p>
<p style="color: purple;"> &#9753;I hope you enjoy your time being here. And by here I mean both Earth and my page. Enjoy!&#10087;</p>
  <h2>My website is a little more about myself</h2>

<p>The following are a couple of things love or simply enjoy. I <strong>love and enjoy</strong> food, music, poetry, videos, etc. It is what I look forward to <em>every</em> day, and what I enjoy doing most. The following goes a little more into detail:</p>

<h3 style="color: blue;">Poetry</h3>
  <p>&#128394;&#128394;&#128394;&#128394;&#128394;&#128394;&#128394;&#128394;</p>

  <p>During my free time, when I decide to be <strong>somewhat</strong> productive, I like to either read poetry or even write it. I started writing poetry since my middle school years and ever since I try to write often. I started a <em> <strong>Wattpad</strong></em> page back in middle school and it received 741 reads, and rankings of: 97/266 from <em>speakingmymind</em>, 966/1000+ from <em>shortpoems</em>, and 922/1000+ from <em>imfine</em>. Poetry has become a way of expressing myself and situations surrounding me. I have written lots of poems, as well as stories based on true events or fictional events that I dream about. I have also written pieces that I would like to turn into songs.  </p>

<h3 style="color: blue;">Videos</h3>
  <p>&#128253;&#128253;&#128253;&#128253;&#128253;&#128253;&#128253;&#128253;<p>

<p>I could watch videos all day if it were possible. However, realistically  speaking I can not. I mean I could but it would not be very productive or healthy. When it comes to watching videos they vary in content. I could watch funny videos about kpop, to theories, and to murder/unsolved cases. YouTube is of course not the only way I watch 'videos'. Even though it is not practically videos, I also enjoy to watch dramas and anime. That however is a different topic to discuss. Which does not necessarily fall into this category, therefore let's move on.</p>

<h3 style="color: blue;">Music</h3>
  <p>&#9835;&#9835;&#9835;&#9835;&#9835;&#9835;&#9835;&#9835;</p>

  <p>When it comes to music I can listen to pretty much anything. It mostly depends on how I am feeling throughout the day. The genre can stay the same for hours up to weeks, or can change drastically within the same day. I have at least 20 top artist from every genre. The reson why I say 20 is because it includes all the genders.  <em>My top female kpop groups</em> are...</p>

  <ul>
  <li>Itzy</li>
  <li>Twice</li>
  <li>Blackpink</li>
  <li>Girls Generation</li>
  <li>Red Relvet</li>
  <li>Everglow</li>
  <li>Dreamcatcher</li>

</ul>

  <h3 style="color: blue;"> Food</h3>
  <p>&#127869;&#127869;&#127869;&#127869;&#127869;&#127869;&#127869;&#127869;</p>
  <p> When it comes to food I am considered a picky eater. However, there are foods I could never get tired of. They can go from homemade foods to fast foods. The following are <em>some</em> of <strong> my favorite foods</strong>. They are labeled from my very favorite, to the simply favorite. </p>

  <ol>
  <li>Pupusas</li>
  <li>Pambazos</li>
  <li>Hamburgers &#127828;</li>
  <li>Gorditas</li>
  <li>Tacos&#127790;</li>
  <li>Caldos</li>
</ol>

  <p style="color: purple;"> Thank you for taking time to read my page. Hope you learned a little more about myself. I hoped you enjoyed your time here, and I hope to see you soon! Goodbye~ &#129322; </p>
